In Practical 4:

1.variables.py 

W should only be true when both X and Y are true (2 marks). Truth table should be in a comment (1 mark).
I didn't provide the truth table, and now I revised it in the comment at the botttom of variables.py

2.File bmi_calculator.py 

Check the code performs the calculation correctly (2 marks) and that different variables give the correct output (1 mark)
My code was unable to run. I checked and found the string is not changed to numerical variable. I add float(), and this is solved now.

Others will be stay as same.
